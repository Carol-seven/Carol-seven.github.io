## [Incorporating auxiliary information in betweenness measure for input-output networks](publication/xiao2022incorporating.qmd)

Published in *Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications*, 2022.

We propose a novel betweenness centrality measure that incorporates available
node-specific auxiliary information for weighted, directed networks.

## [Regional and sectoral structures of the Chinese economy: A network perspective from multi-regional input-output tables](publication/wang2021regional.qmd)

Published in *Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications*, 2021.

We analyze the regional and sectoral structure of the Chinese economy with the province-sector
MRIOTs of China in 2007 and 2012 using network analysis tools.
